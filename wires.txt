-- On the Subject of Blue Wires --
- Well, isn't this a predicament? -

This module will have 6 blue wires, each having its own label.
One wire is the fail-safe, and another is the controller.
To disarm the module, cut the fail-safe followed by the controller.

Cutting the controller before the fail-safe will instantly detonate the bomb.
Cutting the fail-safe and taking more than 3 seconds to cut the controller will detonate the bomb.
Cutting any other wire will cause a strike.

If a rule would prevent any wire from being the controller, ignore it.
The fail-safe wire cannot be the same as the controller wire, controller takes priority.
Follow the rules below until only one wire remains.

Finding the controller:
- If any wire labels have exactly the same name as a present port, they can't be the controller.
- If any wire labels contain exactly 2 vowels, they can't be the controller.
- If any wire labels match an unlit indicator, they can't be the controller.
- If any wire labels contain a vowel, they can't be the controller.
- The wire with the lowest alphabetical name is the controller.

Finding the fail-safe:
- If any wire labels match, they can't be the fail-safe.
- If any wire labels contain duplicate characters, they can't be the fail-safe.
- If any wire labels contain numbers from the serial, they can't be the fail-safe.
- If any wire labels contain exactly one vowel, they can't be the fail-safe.
- The wire with the highest alphabetical name is the fail-safe.
